# stage-alts

My sincerest apologies to those that have reached out for help and I have not given it. My life has taken an extremely busy turn, I managed to get a job where I wake up every day and feel rewarded with my ability to engineer and solver problems, instead of bang my head against a wall and cry real tears over developing a mod that can never seem to be enough for people.

I did not provide with this the tool to generate the config, although that tool was shitty anyways, and I'm sure that someone else can write a better one.

I ask that any improvements to stage-alts be pull requested into this repository, as I am still very proud of the code that I wrote here, it has just taken it's mental toll on me.
